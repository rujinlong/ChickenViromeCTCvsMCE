Description: This package contains metagenomic analysis workflows for investigating 
    the chicken gut virome, focusing on bacteriophage communities (phageome) across 
    intestinal regions and developmental stages. It analyzes spatiotemporal dynamics 
    and compares the impacts of chlortetracycline (CTC) antibiotic versus Macleaya 
    cordata extract (MCE) phytogenic supplementation on viral populations. The analysis 
    uses data from 360 chickens across multiple age points and dietary treatments.
